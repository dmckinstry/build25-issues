## Working with GitHub Issues

_In this section you'll learn the basics of GitHub issues, including issue creation, issue templates, working with labels and milestones, assignment, querying issues, issue hierarchies, issue types, and cross-repo collaboration._

### Getting started with GitHub Issues

- [ ] Create your first issue, based on the "Build Lab-Issue Basics template" issue template using the default settings.
  - Click the **Issues** tab in the top navigation bar of your GitHub repo in the browser (Possible image).
  - Click the green New Issue button on the right side of the browser screen (possible image).
  - Review markdown used in the <b> Description</b> to format content. If you aren't already familiar with markdown you can refer to the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github">GitHub docs</a> for more information.
  - Click the green **Create** button near the bottom of the window.  The template you selected already had everything filled out so you don't need to make any changes. 
- [ ] Assign the new issue to yourself.
  - On the right side of the issue, locate the **Assignees** section and click the link "Assign to yourself". Alternatively you can click the gear icon in that section (Possible Image) and search/filter/select to add assignees.
- [ ] Apply the "enhancement" label to your new issue.
  - Again in the right side, locate the **Labels** section.
  - Click the gear icon in that section (Possible Image) and select "enhancement" checkbox.
  - Click outside the selection area to close the menu.
  - Right now only the default labels are available.  If you're interested in how to create and manage labels in GitHub, refer to the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels).
- [ ] Apply the "Build 2025 Sprint" milestone to your new issue.
  - Using the same process described above, select the gear and then the label.
  - Normally the milestone list defaults to empty, but we prepopulated the available labels for this lab.  Refer to the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones) if you'd like to learn more.
- [ ] Query issues to find and filter this issue and others in your repo.
  - In the top navigation bar in the browser, click on **Issues** (possible image).  This should return a list of all issues that are currently open.  Note that we have prepopulated a bunch of issues for this workshop so that you'll have more to work with in later exercises. (Possible image)
  - Notice the filter text bar; it defaults to the text `is:issue state:open`.  Change that text to include additional text, filtering for the enancement label (i.e., `is:issue state:open label:enhancement`).  Notice that the list shortens to only show the one item you've labeled as an enhancement.
  - You can also filter using the dropdowns for **Author**, **Labels**, **Projects**, **Milestones**, **Assignees**, and the **Open** and **Closed** buttons.  Click on the **Labels** dropdown and clear the enhancement checkbox to return to the original query.
  - Feel free to play around with the filtering; if you'd like more information on filtering with Issues, refer to the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests).
