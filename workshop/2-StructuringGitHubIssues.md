### Structuring GitHub Issues

_Most development teams need more than simple issues to manage development procedures. We've prepopulated a few more issues in your repo so that you can apply issue types and parent/child relationships._
[[PREPOPULATE A "Investigate linking issues to code" and add the batch as a parent]]

- [ ] Create a new issue titled "Apply structure to GitHub Issues" using the blank issue template.
- [ ] Apply the "Task" type to the new issue.
- [ ] From the list of all issues, open the "Investigate Issue Basics" issue and apply the "Task" type.
- [ ] Add the "Batch to track learning GitHub Issues" issue as the Parent relationship of the "Investigate Issue Basics" issue
- [ ] Navigate to the "Batch to track learning GitHub Issues" from the open task.
- [ ] Add the existing "Apply structure to GitHub Issues" task to the open batch.
- [ ] Add a new child task "Verify Issue Hierarchy" to the existing Batch. [[<-- prepopulate?]]
- [ ] Add the "TBD" parent issue to the batch.  Note that this Epic can be found in the TBD/TBD repo.
