### Structuring GitHub Issues

_Most development teams need more than simple issues to manage development procedures. We've prepopulated a few more issues in your repo so that you can apply issue types and parent/child relationships._

- [ ] Create a new issue titled "Apply structure to GitHub Issues" using the blank issue template, with a **Task** Type and assigned to you.
  - This is the same process as in the last exercise, using the green **New issue** button except that:
    - You'll need to select the **Blank issue** template, and
    - You'll need to enter the title "Apply structure to GitHub Issues"
    - If you'd like to practice your Markdown, you can optionally enter a description
  - Notice that at the bottom of the form there are buttons such as **Assignee**, **Label**, etc.  Click the **Assignee** button and assign it to yourself. Again, click outside to popup menu to dismiss it.  This is an alternate way from the last exercise to set issue data during the creation process.
  - Repeat the process to set the **Type** to Task. Note that Issue Types are available in GitHub Enterprise but not currently in all other versions of GitHub.com.
  - Click the green **Create** to complete the creation process.
- [ ] Locate the "Learning GitHub Issues Feature" issue, change it's type to Feature.
  - Select Issues in the top nav to return to the Issues list. You can add the text "Learning" to the filter text to do a text search for the issue (i.e., `is:issue state:open Learning`).
  - Click on the "Learning GitHub Issues Feature" issue to ooen it.
  - Locate the **Type** section on the right side of the form; use the gear icon to select the **Feature** type.  Note that GitHub defaults to types *&Task**, **Bug** and **Feature**, but you can easily [create your own issue types](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/managing-issue-types-in-an-organization).
- [ ] Add a new Task titled "Verify Issue Hierarchy" as a child of this feature.
  - With the "Learning GitHub Issues Feature" issue still open, click the **Create sub-issue** button.
  - Select **Blank Issue** as the template and enter "Verify Issue Hierarchy" as the title.
  - Set the **Type** to Task and click the **Create** button.
- [ ] Add you the Task issues that you created earlier as children of this Feature.
  - Click the dropdown arrow (image) on the **Create sub-issue** button, and select **Add existing issue**.
  - Locate and select the "Investigate Issue Basics" task; you can use the **Search issues** text box if it is difficult to locate.
  - Repeat the process to add the existing "Apply structure to GitHub Issues" task.
  - Note that in an issue hierarchy as shown in this feature, you can click to the left of the children and drag to reorder (VERIFY ON THE VM!!!).
- [ ] Add a parent Issue from a different repo.
  - One of the powerful capabilities in GitHub Issues it the ability to seamlessly track work between repos. In the right column of the issue form, locate the **Relationships** section and click the gear icon (image).
  - Click **Add parent**
  - Notice that above the Search issues text there is an arrow with your repo name (e.g., <-- my-org/my-repo).
  - Click on the arrow to search for a different repo, and enter the text "TBD".
  - Select the "TBD" repo and then select the "TBD" issue as the new parent.
- [ ] Verify the issue hierarchy
  - On the right side of the issue form, click on the parent issue that you just configured; this will open the parent issue that you just configured.
  - From the parent issue, click the Expand/Collapse button next to your issue and verify the hierarchy:
    (Image)
    Note that you may actually see issue hierarchies for other workshop participants; that is fine, as long as your issue looks good.
  - Select the "Verify Issue Hierarchy" issue in the list to open that task.
  - On text area near the bottom of the form, enter "Verification Complete" and click the **Close issue** button.
  - Click outside the "Verify Issue Hierarchy" form to dismiss it.
  - Notice that in the hierarchy, that issue is now marked as closed.  We could go back and close the other Tasks and the Feature itself as we've completed those exercises.  But there is a more efficient way that we'll explore in the next exercise.

In this exercise you've seen how issues can have types, parent-child relationships, and cross-repo linkage. Unlike some other systems, issue types are easily changed and we don't inherently force issue hierarchies by type (e.g., you could have a task that is a parent of a feature which is a parent of a bug)... how you track work is easily maleable to the way YOU want to work!
