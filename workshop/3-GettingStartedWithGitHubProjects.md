## Managing work with GitHub Projects
_GitHub Projects project a management layer on top of Issues, providing custom fields, custom workflows, visualizations, automation, and ...TBD... In this exercise we'll investigate creating projects, adding issues, adding drafts, adding fields, and customizing workflow status.

### Project Fundamentals

- [ ] Create a new project with a name that you'll recognize (e.g., "Dave's lab project"), starting from scratch with a Table.
  - TBD
- [ ] Add a new Task Issue to the project in your repo, using the "Blank Issue" template and with the title "Customize Project Status and Fields"
  - Next to the "+" at the bottom of the table, type the title "Customize Project Status and Fields"
  - Press Return/Enter to accept the title
  - Verify that your repo is selected and select "Blank Issue" as the template
  - At the bottom of the form, select "Task" as the type
  - Click the Create button to save the new issue.
- [ ] Add the "Investigate Issues Basics" to the project
  - Next to the "+" at the bottom of the table, type the hash symbol (#) to open the repo selector.
  - If nexessary, select your repo
  - Select on the "Investigate Issues Basics" issue that you created
- [ ] Repeat the above process to add the "Add Structure to Issues" and "Batch to track learning GitHub Issues" issues to the project
- [ ] Add a draft item named "TBD" to the project; drafts do not have a backing issue and have fewer capabilities but are easier to work with and not tied to an individual repo.
  - Next to the "+" at the bottom of the table, type the title "This is a draft item on the project"
  - Note the popup menu including "Create a draft".  You can select on that menu item or press Control (or Command for mac) and Return/Enter.
    The draft has been added.  It can be modified or removed, like any other item in the project, or converted into an issue.
