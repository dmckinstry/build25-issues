## Working with Project Views
_One of the valuable components in Projects is the ability to customize how you view and interact with a group of related work. In this exercise we will filter, slice, and create a variety of different project views._

### Filtering and Project Data
If you're not already, get the the project board and the default view.
- [ ] Rename the first view as "Feature Planning"
- [ ] Add a filter to only show opem issues with the "Feature" type
- [ ] 


- [ ] Create a new project with a name that you'll recognize (e.g., "Dave's lab project"), starting from scratch with a Table.
  - Click on **Projects** in the GitHub top nav.
  - Click on the **+ New project** green button on the right side above the (likely empty) project list.
  - Review the "Featured" templates in the "Create project" dialog, but don't select one. Instead, select **Table** on the left side under "Start from scratch".
  - Give the title a "Project name" that you'll recognize (e.g., "Dave's workshop project").
  - Click the green **Create project** button on the lower-right of the form. 
- [ ] Add a new Task Issue to the project in your repo, using the "Blank Issue" template and with the title "Customize Project Status and Fields"
  - Next to the "+" at the bottom of the table, type the title "Customize Project Status and Fields"
  - Press Return/Enter to accept the title
  - Verify that your repo is selected and select "Blank Issue" as the template
  - At the bottom of the form, select "Task" as the type
  - Click the Create button to save the new issue.
- [ ] Add all of the remaining issues in your repo to the project
  - Next to the "+" at the bottom of the table, type the hash symbol (#) to open the repo selector.
  - Click on your repo name.
  - At the bottom of the popup list, select "Add items from *your-org/your repo*".
  - In the top of the form, select **Select all items**
  - Click the green **Add selected items** button in the lower-right of the form.
  - Click outside the "Add items to project" form to close it.
- [ ] Add a draft item named "Investigate draft issues" to the project; drafts do not have a backing issue and have fewer capabilities but are easier to work with and not tied to an individual repo.
  - Click in the textbox next to the "+" at the bottom of the table.  If your repo is listed, you'll need to delete it before proceeding.
  - Type the title "Investigate draft issues"
  - Note that the popup menu has the option to **Create a draft issue**. You can click that button or press Control (or Command) + Return/Enter to create the draft.
  - Note the popup menu including **Create a draft**.  Select that item on that menu item or press Control (or Command for mac) and Return/Enter.
    The draft has been added.  It can be modified or removed, like any other item in the project, or converted into an issue.

### Customize Status and Fields
- [ ] Add a new **Single select** project field for "Priority"
  - Locate and click on the **+** in the header row of the far right column of the table, and select **+ New field**.
  - Enter "Priority" as the "Field name" and select "Single select" as the "Field type".
  - In the "Add option.." textbox, enter `:fire: High` and click the **Add** button.
  - Repeat adding options for `:yellow_circle: Medium` and `:ice_cube: Not going to happen`.
  - Click the green **Save** button to add the field.
- [ ] Repeat the process above to add Date fields for "Start" and "End".
  - As stated, the process is identify except that the names are different and the **Date* type doesn't require additional "Add option..." steps.
- [ ] Add a new Status for "Paused"
  - In the table header, click on the elipses **...** next to the "Status" header.
  - Click on the **Field settings** option.
  - In the **Add option...** textbox type `Paused` and click the **Add** button.
  - If you'd like to change the item's color or add a description, you can do that by clicking the elipses **...** to the right of the item.
  - In the top left of the screen, locate and click the **<-- Settings** button to return to the project view.
