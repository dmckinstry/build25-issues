## Workshop setup
>> NOTE - This model setups up in an user org - we need to run in a GHE to get Issue Types.
>> NOTE - I plan to populate all system-generated issues and a label as part of an Actions workflow that runs when deploying from the template.
>> Also pre-populate a bug for fixing the README (some obvious error) and create the fix in a branch.

To complete this workshop you will need to create a repository for your personal work.  This is accomplished through the use of a [template repository][template-repo]. Template repositories are a great way to provide starters for your organization, ensuring consistency across projects. The repository for this workshop is configured as a template, so we can use it to create your repository.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure you have the [requisite software][required-software] and [requisite resources][required-resources] setup.
