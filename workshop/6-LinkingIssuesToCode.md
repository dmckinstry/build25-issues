### Linking Issues to Code
_Linking code to issues is a common pattern within GitHub. It is frequently used to associate code changes with the issues that caused them (bugs, feature requests, etc.). We saved this exercise to late in the lab so that you can see the code and PR in the context of the overall project._

_In this exercise you will..._

- [ ] Identify the existing Bug related to the README file and not the issue number.
  - TBD
- [ ] Open a PR for the bug fix in the fix-readme branch with the description "closes #n", where "n" is the issue number for the bug.
  - TBD
- [ ] Review the PR code and merge the PR.
- [ ] Return to the project board and note that the PR and issue have been completed
- [ ] Review the issue and PR linkage
